# DigitalThermometer
This is a pet project. I have created a digital thermometer using Arduino NANO, DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and 1602A LCD, which measures temperature in four different scales. I.e., Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Réaumur.

## Features
- Measures temperature in Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Reaumur
- Uses Arduino NANO as the main controller
- Utilizes DS18B20 digital temperature sensor for accurate readings
- Displays temperature on 1602A LCD
- Supports temperature conversion between scales
